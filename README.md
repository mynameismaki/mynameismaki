### 📂 Exploring My Jupyter Notebooks
- **Mainly Python!:** My Jupyter notebooks are predominantly used for the IBM Data Analyst Specialization, particularly for [IBM Courses Projects](https://github.com/mynameismaki/IBM-Courses-Projects) and the [IBM Capstone](https://github.com/mynameismaki/IBM-Capstone-Projects)!
- For instance, I utilized them to import and investigate the [2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/) dataset.
```
import pandas as pd
import requests as r
dataset_url = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DAB321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m1_survey_data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(dataset_url)
```

- After data processing and analysis, I developed a presentation based on the findings. In this instance, I was instructed to construct my dashboards using [IBM Cognos Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/products/cognos-analytics).

### 🔍 Portfolio Highlight: Brazilian E-Commerce Analysis

- This project delves into **The Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist** from Kaggle, a rich resource of real-world e-commerce transactions in Brazil. Through this analysis, I aimed to uncover key insights into:

- **Customer Behavior:** Understanding purchasing patterns, preferences, and segmentation.
- **Sales Performance:** Evaluating sales trends, top-performing products, and revenue drivers.
- **Logistical Efficiency:** Examining delivery times, shipping patterns, and potential bottlenecks.
